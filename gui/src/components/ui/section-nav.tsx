/*
 * The left-hand list of a screen with sections, and the heading each opens.
 *
 * A settings screen is the usual case: five or six sections, each its own
 * address so it can be linked to and the back button walks between them,
 * listed down the left with the current one tinted. Every product draws the
 * same column, and every product draws the active row a little differently -
 * which is exactly the drift a shared list exists to stop.
 *
 * The rows are the product's links, not the component's. `render` takes the
 * item and answers with the element to draw it as - a router's `NavLink`, an
 * `<a>`, whatever the product navigates with - and the component puts the
 * row's clothes, its icon and its `aria-current` on it. Without `render` a
 * row is a button and `onSelect` says which one was pressed, for a screen
 * whose sections are state rather than routes.
 *
 * `SectionHeading` is the other half: the title and the one-line hint above
 * a section's body, so the column and the page it opens are set in the same
 * type.

/*
 * A box that scrolls, with the line's scrollbar drawn over its content.
 *
 * The line has one rule for scrollbars: a thin bar laid over the content,
 * never a gutter that takes width. A gutter is a column of the layout that
 * comes and goes with the length of the content, so a list that grows past
 * the fold pushes everything beside it sideways by the width of a bar - and
 * on a platform that draws a classic bar, the product wears someone else's
 * chrome in the middle of its own screen. The theme's global scrollbar rules
 * make native bars thin, but thin is still a gutter wherever the platform
 * draws one; only a bar that is not the browser's can promise to take no room.
 *
 * So the viewport hides its native bars and Base UI draws the thumb, sized and
 * placed from the scroll position. The bar is invisible at rest and appears
 * while the pointer is over the area or while it scrolls, because a bar that
 * is always there is a line across the content that nobody asked for. The
 * track is wider than the thumb and the thumb thickens under the pointer: a
 * four-pixel thumb reads as a hint and is hopeless as a grip, and the grip is
 * what somebody reaching for it wants. Both axes are handled, and Base UI
 * mounts a bar only for an axis that actually overflows.
 *
 * The keyboard is the part a hand-drawn scrollbar usually loses. A box that
 * scrolls must be reachable, or a reader without a pointer cannot see what is
 * below the fold (axe's `scrollable-region-focusable`), so Base UI makes the
 * viewport a tab stop exactly when it overflows. A tab stop has to be called
 * something, and the viewport is then a named group - which is why `label` is
 * required: whether the content will overflow is not known when the product
 * is written, and a name added only for the long case is a name forgotten for
 * it.
 *
 * `fade` softens the edges where there is more to see. It reads Base UI's
 * overflow distances, so an edge that is already at its end is left sharp -
 * a fade on both ends of a list scrolled to the top would say there is
 * something above when there is not.
 *
 * `orientation` says which way the content may move. Base UI sizes its content
 * box to `fit-content`, which is right for a table that scrolls sideways and
 * wrong for a list: a row that should truncate to the column instead widens
 * the box, and the list scrolls sideways by the length of its longest title.
 * `vertical` holds the content to the viewport's width; `horizontal` holds it
 * to the viewport's height.

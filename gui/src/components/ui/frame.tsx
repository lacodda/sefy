/*
 * Frame, Pane and ListDetail.
 *
 * The geometry of a screen whose bottom edge is the window's: a column that
 * hands its height down and scrolls nowhere itself, a panel whose bars stand
 * while its body scrolls between them, and a list beside what is open in it.
 *
 * Harvested from kilna, where it is the frame every screen and every tab of a
 * card is laid out in. It exists there because the obvious way to build a
 * screen - a column that scrolls - is wrong in three ways at once, and an
 * audit found eleven screens built that way after a release had said none
 * were: the head went up with the content, a table's sticky header had
 * nothing to stick to, and a field at the foot of a tab drifted off the
 * bottom of the window with everything above it.
 *
 * So the column never scrolls. Only a part of the body does:
 *
 * - `Frame` - a screen's column. A head that stands, a body that takes the
 *   rest, sometimes a foot that stands too.
 * - `Pane` - a panel with a bar at the top, a body that scrolls, and a bar
 *   at the foot: an open note, a version being read, a list with its search.
 * - `ListDetail` - a list beside what is open in it. kilna drew six such
 *   screens with five widths and three gaps; there are two widths here, a
 *   list's and the rail's (`--spacing-list`, `--spacing-rail`), and one gap.
 *
 * The gap is ten pixels between the blocks of a screen, whichever of these
 * holds them - the mockup's, and kilna's on every screen.
 *
 * What kilna never needed is a narrow window: it is a desktop product with a
 * floor on its width. The products on the web have phones, and a list beside
 * its detail at 390px is two columns too narrow to read. Below 672px of its
 * own width - a container query, so a rail beside it counts - ListDetail
 * shows one of the two: the list until something is open, then the open
 * thing alone, with `ListDetailBack` in its head to return. That is how a
 * list and its detail work at that width everywhere else, from mail to
 * settings, and it is decided here once rather than by each screen - as is
 * where the focus goes when the two trade places (`useListDetailTurn`).
